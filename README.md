App description: 
This repository contains the Flutter code for a note-taking app. The user must register using a valid email address and a strong password. After successfully verifying the user's email address, the user is redirected to the application's landing page, which shows the notes view. The application supports the following list of CRUD operations:

* New notes can be added using the plus icon on the app bar. The application leads the user to a blank page where they can add notes when clicking the plus icon. 

* The user can exit and resume from the same point at any time, as the notes are automatically saved when the back button is pressed to leave the writing page. 

* Existing notes are listed on the landing page, and clicking on any note displays its contents.

* A delete confirmation dialogue is displayed when the user deletes a note from the notes view.

* The user can log out of the application, and a confirmation popup is shown to confirm this action.

Challenges faced:

In the initial stages of the course, I struggled in the depth of the Dart programming language. Object Oriented Programming was a very new thing to me as I hadn't touched java before but I gave my best to learn it properly. There were many concepts that the course breezed through but I had to google them myself on the internet to understand them properly. I felt that I was able to understand what the language meant with each passing day. I heaved a sigh of relief when the course actually got to the point of applying Flutter to make applications, but still there were many challenges ahead.

When I started to do Auth Service, I struggled a lot initially. I couldn't get what an auth provider and auth service was and what they did. After reading a lot of documentation on the web, I could get a vague idea of what it was. But as I proceeded further in the course, I realized that what I had assumed in the beginning was partially correct, and there was more to it. It became overwhelming at times because absorbing many new things seemed challenging. As I was following an online course, I couldn't confirm whether what I was thinking was wholly correct or not and was forced to assume things at a point in time. Still, I learned to google stuff because of this, and learnt many things along the way. 
I still haven't understood AuthService properly, as I couldn't properly create the Google Sign In method.


Local storage:
It included a lot of concepts that were very new to me
and I faced difficulty in understanding a lot of things being a beginner. We used SQL for local storage and DB browser for SQL. I couldn't understand what SQLite was, the proper working and functioning of the DB browser, maps, NotesService, NotesServiceController, Factory Constructors, and the basic syntax of some commands, which looked scary at first. I spent about three days thoroughly understanding the functioning of various commands. Everything was overwhelming initially, but I got used to things till the end.

Generics:
The course used it in an extension method called getArgument. It still feels a bit cryptic. I haven't understood it wholly yet, as it occurred in the later stages of the course, and I will revisit it soon.

Overall, I really enjoyed doing the course each day. I could feel myself getting better each and every day, which gave me the motivation and drive to go on and learn new things while maintaining my academics. Whatever the result, the thing I enjoyed was working hard and consistently on a thing which I enjoyed and will continue to do.
